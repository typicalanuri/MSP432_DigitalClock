# MSP432_DigitalClock
The program creates a digital clock on TI MSP 432 board and an MK II booster pack. The digital clock is displayed on the lcd display screen. The user can use the S1 and S2 push buttons to increment the hour and minutes. Every time the counter is incremented, a tone is generated by the buzzer. The lcd display is cleared after 5 seconds, if the board stays still for 5 seconds, the accelerometer angle values are used to determine if the board is stable.
